# Motivation

We use Nix to package all of the dependencies for our dev environment. It does several things for us:

- Enables new devs on macOS or Linux to set up our dev environment with just one command
- Makes sure that everybody on the team is using the same versions of all the tools
- Allows us to isolate development dependencies from affecting the host system

For how Nix package management works, please refer to the official [how Nix works guide](https://nixos.org/guides/how-nix-works.html).

# Supported workflows

Some workflows require additional steps after the Nix installation. These steps are documented in [Workflow prerequisites](#workflow-prerequisites).

| Workflow                        | macOS supported |
| ------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `keyserver` (Node.js)           | ✅              |
| `web` (Webpack)                 | ✅              |
| `native` iOS (React Native)     | ✅              |
| `native` Android (React Native) | ✅              |
| C++ services                    | ❌ **\***       |
| Rust services                   | ✅              |

**\*** Workflow requires documentation; and it requires the RabbitMQ and AWS/Localstack services to be available.

# Requirements

To set up a dev environment using Nix, you will need a macOS or Linux machine.

# Prerequisites

## Nix package manager

To install and configure the [Nix package manager](https://nixos.org), please run:

```
./scripts/install_nix.sh
```

## Workflow prerequisites

On macOS, [installing Xcode](./nix_mobile_setup.md#xcode) is a prerequisite for all workflows.

- [Web prerequisites](./nix_web_setup.md#nix-web-requisities)
  - [React Dev Tools Chrome extension](./nix_web_setup.md#react-dev-tools-chrome-extension)
  - [Redux Dev Tools Chrome extension](./nix_web_setup.md#redux-dev-tools-chrome-extension)
  - [Flipper (React Native Debugger)](./nix_mobile_setup.md#flipper)
- [Mobile prerequisites](./nix_mobile_setup.md#nix-mobile-prerequisites)
  - [Xcode](./nix_mobile_setup.md#xcode)
    - [Xcode settings](./nix_mobile_setup.md#xcode-settings)
  - [Android Studio](./nix_mobile_setup.md#android-studio)
    - [Android SDK](./nix_mobile_setup.md#android-sdk)
    - [Android Emulator](./nix_mobile_setup.md#android-emulator)
  - [Flipper (React Native Debugger)](./nix_mobile_setup.md#flipper)

# Development environment

Run `nix develop` to create a dev environment. Nix will handle the installation of all remaining dependencies not mentioned in [Workflow prerequisites](#workflow-prerequisites).

## How Nix introduces dependencies to a development environment

Nix installs packages in the Nix store at package-specific paths (e.g. `/nix/store/x7kdiasp...-clang/bin/clang`). When you run `nix develop`, Nix sets environment variables such as `PATH` to expose the binary dependencies to your shell. This model can be extended through shell hooks to support other build toolchains such as `pkg-config`, `cmake`, and many other language specific package managers by simply adding the respective toolchain to `nativeBuildInputs`.
