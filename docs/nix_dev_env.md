# Motivation

We use Nix to package all of the dependencies for our dev environment. It does several things for us:

- Enables new devs on macOS or Linux to set up our dev environment with just one command
- Makes sure that everybody on the team is using the same versions of all the tools
- Allows us to isolate development dependencies from affecting the host system

For how Nix package management works, please refer to the official [how Nix works guide](https://nixos.org/guides/how-nix-works.html).

# Supported workflows

Some workflows require additional steps after the Nix installation. These steps are documented in [Workflow prerequisites](#workflow-prerequisites).

| Workflow                        | macOS supported |
| ------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `keyserver` (Node.js)           | ✅              |
| `web` & `landing` (Webpack)     | ✅              |
| `native` iOS (React Native)     | ✅              |
| `native` Android (React Native) | ✅              |
| C++ services                    | ❌ **\***       |
| Rust services                   | ✅              |

**\*** Workflow requires documentation; and it requires the RabbitMQ and AWS/Localstack services to be available.

# Requirements

To set up a dev environment using Nix, you will need a macOS or Linux machine.

# Prerequisites

## Xcode

For developers using macOS, go to the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835) to install Xcode; or if you already have it, update it to the latest version.

Once Xcode is installed, open it up. If you are prompted, follow the instructions to install any [“Additional Required Components”](./nix_mobile_setup.md#xcode-settings)

### Xcode Command Line Tools

For developers using macOS, you need to make sure that the Xcode “Command Line Tools” are installed. You can do this by running:

```
xcode-select --install
```

## Nix package manager

To install and configure the [Nix package manager](https://nixos.org), please run:

```
# Pull down Git repository
git clone git@github.com:CommE2E/comm.git
cd comm

# Install Nix and Comm binary cache
./scripts/install_nix.sh
```

Now either close and reopen your terminal window or re-source your shell configuration file in order to have changes applied.

## Install development dependencies

As a first step, you’ll want to set up the JavaScript environment and pull in all necessary NPM packages. Run the following command:

```
# Create development shell
nix develop

# Install yarn dependencies
yarn cleaninstall
```

## Workflow specific prerequisites

On macOS, [installing Xcode](#xcode) is a prerequisite for all workflows.

## Using alternate shells with Nix

Alternate shells such as zsh or fish can also be used with Nix. To use an alternate shell, run:

```sh
nix develop -c $SHELL
```

You may also replace the bash shell with the shell of your preference.

```sh
nix develop
exec zsh # or fish
```

## How Nix introduces dependencies to a development environment

Nix installs packages in the Nix store at package-specific paths (e.g. `/nix/store/x7kdiasp...-clang/bin/clang`). When you run `nix develop`, Nix sets environment variables such as `PATH` to expose the binary dependencies to your shell. This model can be extended to support other build toolchains such as pkg-config, CMake, and many other language specific package managers.
