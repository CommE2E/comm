# Requirements

Please note that our dev environment currently only works on macOS and Linux.

For the Linux instructions [head to the Linux configuration steps](linux_dev_environment).

    <summary> Why not Windows? (click to expand) </summary>
        <p>
        It’s primarily because Apple only supports iOS development using macOS. It’s true that we could support web, server, and Android development on other operating systems, but because of the Apple requirement, all of our active developers currently run macOS. We’d very much welcome a PR to build out support on Windows!

Unfortunately the dev environment is overall pretty heavy.

You’ll ideally want a machine with at least 32 GiB of RAM, although 16 GiB should suffice.
