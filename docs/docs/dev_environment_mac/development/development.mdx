# Development

## Flow typechecker

It’s good to run the `flow` typechecker frequently to make sure you’re not introducing any type errors. Flow treats each Yarn Workspace as a separate environment, and as such runs a separate type-checking server for each. This server is started when you first run `node_modules/.bin/flow` in each of the four Yarn Workspace folders.

To make sure Flow runs from the command-line, you can edit your `$PATH` environmental variable in your `~/.bash_profile` file (or desired shell configuration file) to always include `./node_modules/.bin`.

```shell
export PATH=$PATH:./node_modules/.bin
```

As always, make sure you reload the `~/.bash_profile` after editing it:

```shell
source ~/.bash_profile
```

You should now be able to run `flow` in any of the Yarn workspaces:

```shell
cd lib
flow
```

## Running web app

Open a new terminal and run:

```shell
cd web
yarn dev
```

This will start two processes. One is `webpack-dev-server`, which will serve the JS files. `webpack-dev-server` also makes sure the website automatically hot-reloads whenever any of the source files change. The other process is `webpack --watch`, which will build the `app.build.cjs` file, as well as rebuilding it whenever any of the source files change. The `app.build.cjs` file is consumed by the Node server in order to pre-render the initial HTML from the web source (“Server-Side Rendering”).

## Running landing page

Open a new terminal and run:

```shell
cd landing
yarn dev
```

This runs the same two processes as the web app, but for the landing page.

:::note
  The `landing.build.cjs` file (similar to the web app’s `app.build.cjs` file) is consumed by the Node server.
:::

## Running server

Open a new terminal and run:

```shell
cd server
yarn dev
```

You should now be able to load the web app in your web browser at <http://localhost/comm/>, and the landing page at <http://localhost/commlanding/>.

This command runs three processes. The first two are to keep the `dist` folder updated whenever the `src` folder changes. They are “watch” versions of the same Babel and `rsync` commands we used to initially create the `dist` folder (before running the `create-db.js` script above). The final process is `nodemon`, which is similar to `node` except that it restarts whenever any of its source files (in the `dist` directory) changes.

:::caution
  If you run `yarn dev` in `server` right after `yarn cleaninstall`, before Webpack is given a chance to build `app.build.cjs`/`landing.build.cjs` files, then Node will crash when it attempts to import those files. Just make sure to run `yarn dev` (or `yarn prod`) in `web` or `landing` before attempting to load the corresponding webpages.

## Running mobile app on iOS Simulator

First, make sure that the Metro bundler is running. If you haven’t already, open a new terminal and run:

```shell
cd native
yarn dev
```

This command runs two processes. The first is the Metro bundler, which handles bundling our app’s JavaScript code and communicating with the debug build of the app running on either a physical or virtual device. The second is the `remotedev-server` for Redux, which is a proxy of sorts through which the Redux monitor (running in the Chrome extension) can communicate with the debug build of the app.

Next, open `native/ios/Comm.xcworkspace` in Xcode. Select a Simulator from the Scheme menu in the Workspace Toolbar. Then hit the Run button to build and run the project.

## Running mobile app on Android Emulator

First, make sure that the Metro bundler is running. If you haven’t already, open a new terminal and run:

```shell
cd native
yarn dev
```

This command runs two processes (see previous section for details).

Next, boot up an Android Emulator using Android Studio’s AVD Manager. You should have a single Android Emulator (or plugged-in device) running at one time.

Finally, use this command to build and run the Android app:

```shell
cd native
yarn react-native run-android
```

## Running mobile app on physical iOS devices

There are a few things you’ll need to do before you can deploy the app to a physical iOS device.

### Xcode settings

First, in Xcode, open the Comm workspace `native/ios/Comm.xcworkspace`. Make sure that you’re signed into Xcode with an Apple Developer account (either the Comm developer team’s or your own). You can see any accounts currently associated with Xcode by navigating to Xcode → Preferences → Accounts.

Next, you’ll want to ensure that the Comm project is configured with a valid Team, Bundle Identifier, and Provisioning Profile. To access these settings, navigate to View → Navigators → Project, and select the “Comm” project in the left sidebar. Then, select “Comm” from the “TARGETS” list, and navigate to the “Signing & Capabilities” tab. You should verify the following settings:

<Tabs groupId="account-type">
  <TabItem value="comm-dev" label="Using a Comm development team Apple Developer account">
    <ul>
      <li> Team </li>
        <ul>
          <li> Comm Technologies, Inc. </li>
        </ul>
      <li> Bundle Identifier </li>
        <ul>
          <li> app.comm </li>
        </ul>
              <li> Provisioning Profile </li>
        <ul>
          <li> Make sure that the Provisioning Profile exists </li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="personal" label="Using a Personal Apple Developer account">
    <ul>
      <li> Team </li>
        <ul>
          <li> Set this to a valid “Team”, which can just be your personal Apple Developer account. “Comm Technologies, Inc.” may be chosen by default, but it’s not valid if you’re using a personal Apple Developer account </li>
        </ul>
      <li> Bundle Identifier </li>
        <ul>
          <li> Pick a unique
            <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/preparing-your-app-for-distribution"> Bundle Identifier</a>
          </li>
        </ul>
              <li> Provisioning Profile </li>
        <ul>
          <li> Make sure that the Provisioning Profile exists </li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Building and deploying the app

When you plug your iOS device into your machine for the first time, you’ll be prompted to enter your device passcode to enable debugging and deployment. Click the ”Register” button in the dialog that Xcode displays if your device needs to be added to your Provisioning Profile.

Make sure to pull the latest changes and clean the build folder before trying to deploy a build to your device. In Xcode, run Product → Clean Build Folder.

If you’re running a debug build, you’ll need to check that the Metro bundler is running. If you haven’t already, open a new terminal and run:

```shell
cd native
yarn dev
```

This command runs the Metro bundler and `remotedev-server` for Redux (see the “Running mobile app on iOS simulator” section for more details).

You should finally be ready to build and deploy the app in Xcode! Select your physical device from ”run destinations” in the Workspace Toolbar. Then hit the Run button to build and run the project.

If you’re connecting to a local server instance, you’ll want to “Allow Comm to Access” the “Local Network” in your device Settings. This toggle can be found from Settings → Comm. Note that this setting is not enabled by default, and you may have to re-enable it on subsequent build deployments.

### Connecting to local server

If you want your custom build of the app to connect to your local instance of the Node.js server (the `server` subdirectory of the repo), you’ll need to do some additional work. First, confirm that your computer and physical iOS device are on the same network. If you’re running a local server instance, you’ll need to be able to reach it with your device. Local servers run on the local IP address at port 8043.

To find your machine’s local IP address, navigate to System Preferences → Network, and select the hardware interface you’re currently using to connect to the internet (Wi-Fi, or potentially a Thunderbolt port for ethernet connections). Next, click “Advanced” and go to the “TCP/IP” tab. Your local IP address is listed as the “IPv4 Address”. Try visiting this IP address using a browser on your device. It should display an “It works!” message if your iOS device can reach your machine.

Finally, we need to direct the mobile app to use your local server instance. There are a few different ways to do this, depending on your situation:

<Tabs groupId="deployment-type">
  <TabItem value="debug" label="Deploying a debug build">
Create a `network.json` file in `native/facts` that will override the default.

```shell
mkdir -p native/facts
vim native/facts/network.json
```

Your `network.json` file should look like the following, where `w.x.y.z` is the local IP address you found earlier:

```json
{
  "natDevHostname": "w.x.y.z"
}
```

You’ll need to delete and reinstall the app for changes to `native/facts/network.json` to take effect, as the default production URL is persisted in Redux.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="release" label="Deploying a release build">

- If you’re deploying a release build, your best bet to override the server URL is to get to the secret “Developer tools” menu option in the app.
  - You may need to use a real production account for this, since the server address will default to the production server if this is the first build you've deployed to the target device.
  - Next, in order for the “Developer tools” menu option to appear, you’ll need to add your user ID to [the list of user IDs in `staff.json`](https://github.com/CommE2E/comm/blob/master/lib/facts/staff.json). A good way to figure out your user ID is to use the Chrome Redux debugger to inspect the `currentUserInfo` property when logged into the web app.
  - Finally, you should be able to navigate to Profile → Developer tools in the app and set the address of the local server. It should look something like the following, where `w.x.y.z` is the local IP address you found earlier.

      ```shell
      http://w.x.y.z/comm
      ```


  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Running Node scripts

To run one of the scripts in `server/src/scripts`, you should start by making sure that the Node server is running. If you haven’t already, open a new terminal and run:

```shell
cd native
yarn dev
```

Then, from the `server` directory, run `yarn script dist/scripts/name.js`, where `name.js` is the file containing the script.

## Codegen

We use a couple of tools that automatically generate code.

:::tip
  There is always a source of truth – usually some file(s) with schemas.
:::

### Codegen for JSI

JSI is a framework in React Native that allows C++ and JS to communicate synchronously and directly. The codegen for JSI takes a Flow schema and generates C++ files that enable communication between JS and C++ in `react-native` apps.

The script to generate this code is written in JavaScript and is included as a npm package so no additional software is needed to use it. The schema has to be defined in Flow as an interface, and that interface must inherit from react-native’s `TurboModule` interface.

To run the JSI codegen, just run `cd native && yarn codegen-jsi`. The input Flow schemas are located in `native/schema`.
