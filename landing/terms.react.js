      <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
      <p>
        Effective date: <strong>June 29, 2021</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        These Terms of Use (the “Terms”) are a binding contract between you and{' '}
        <strong>COMM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.</strong> (“Comm Technologies,” “we” and
        “us”) and govern your use of our website, products, services and
        applications (the “Services”). Your use of the Services in any way means
        that you agree to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in
        effect while you use the Services. These Terms include the provisions in
        this document as well as those in the{' '}
        <a href="https://comm.app/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Will these Terms ever change?</h2>

      <p>
        We may change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will place a
        notice on our site located at{' '}
        <a href="https://comm.app">https://comm.app</a>. If you don’t agree with
        the new Terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means
        you will no longer be able to use the Services. If you use the Services
        in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, that means you
        agree to all of the changes.
      </p>

        there are risks in doing so, and that Comm Technologies is not
        responsible for such risks. We encourage you to be aware when you leave
        the Services and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of
        each third-party website or service that you visit or utilize.
      </p>

      <h2>Will Comm Technologies ever change the Services?</h2>

      <p>
        We’re always trying to improve our Services, so they may change over
        time. We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may
        introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict
        access to parts or all of the Services.
      </p>

      <h2>What if I want to stop using the Services?</h2>

      <p>
        You’re free to do that at any time, either by deleting your account
        within the app, or by contacting us at{' '}
        <a href="mailto:support@comm.app">support@comm.app</a>; please refer to
        our <a href="https://comm.app/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, as well as
        the licenses above, to understand how we treat information you provide
        to us after you have stopped using our Services. Termination of your
        account may or may not result in destruction of Content associated with
        your account, and other Comm users may continue to have access to and
        control over your Content.
      </p>

      <p>
        Comm Technologies is also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your
        use of the Services or your account for any reason at our discretion,
        including your breach of these Terms, including any violation of the
        acceptable‑use requirements above. Comm Technologies has the sole right
        to decide whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions set
        forth in these Terms.
      </p>

      <p>
        Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these
        Terms shall survive termination. By way of example, all of the following
        will survive termination: any limitations on our liability, any terms
        regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms regarding
        disputes between us.
      </p>
