      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

      <p>
        Effective date: <strong>February 2, 2023</strong>
      </p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        We built Comm as a privacy-focused alternative to the cloud-based
        community chat apps that exist today. In order to protect the privacy of
        user content, communities on Comm are hosted on private keyservers, and
        messages transmitted through the platform are encrypted, preventing us
        from being able to access their contents. While Comm does collect a
        minimal amount of information as necessary to power and maintain the
        Services, Comm will never be able to access or view the substance of
        your Content. This Privacy Policy describes the limited ways in which
        Comm uses information in connection with its Services.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>
          ‌By using or accessing our Services, you acknowledge that you accept
          the practices and policies outlined below.
        </strong>

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

      <p>
        We collect the following categories of information, some of which might
        constitute personal information:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Account Information.</strong> In order to use Comm, you will
          be required to create an account, and in doing so, may be required to
          provide a username and password to us. We only store salted and hashed
          versions of your password – we never store the plaintext version. No
          other information is required to create an account and we do not want
          you to provide any other information.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Blockchain Account Information.</strong> You may instead
          choose to log into Comm using a third-party blockchain provider (such
          as, Sign-In with Ethereum or similar functionality), in which case you
          will be required to provide your blockchain address to us. The only
          information we collect as part of this process is information that is
          already publicly available.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Backup Service.</strong> You have the option to back up your
          Content on Comm’s hosted servers, allowing you to recover any
          backed-up Content. If you do not opt out of the backup service, your
          Content will be stored in our automated backup service.{' '}
          <strong>
            Your Content will always remain end-to-end encrypted, even when
            stored through our backup service.
          </strong>{' '}
          You may recover your backed-up Content through an automatic recovery
          process available through your account. If you request your Content,
          Comm will verify your identity cryptographically to verify that the
          Content you are requesting belongs to you; however, such request will
          not allow Comm to collect or view any information that is not already
          outlined in this Privacy Policy and your backed-up Content will only
          be associated with your account. The backup service only allows Comm
          to collect encrypted versions of your Content – at no point will Comm
          have the ability to access or view the substance of your Content nor
          will Comm ever have the ability to decrypt your Content collected
          through the backup service. You may opt-out of this backup service at
          any time by doing so within the app.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Updates About the Services.</strong> If you choose to receive
          updates on Comm’s progress, you will be required to provide your email
          address to us. If you choose to send any emails to us in response to
          such updates or otherwise, we may collect the content of such emails.
          These email addresses, and any emails received from you, will not be
          associated with any accounts, and will not be used for any purpose
          other than to provide updates on Comm and to otherwise respond to you.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Time Zone Detection.</strong> When responding to a web
          request, we use the requester’s IP address in order to determine which
          time zone to render timestamps in. We do not store these IP addresses
          or associate them with specific accounts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Security, Fraud and Abuse.</strong> In order to detect and
          prevent abuse of our Services and cyberattacks, we keep track of
          request metadata, which includes requests made by IP addresses as well
          as the frequency of those requests. This data is only stored on a
          short-term basis and is never associated with specific accounts, even
          if the requests themselves originate from or are associated with
          specific accounts. Additionally, we may view and block certain IP
          address ranges as necessary to comply with applicable United States
          export control laws and regulations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Optimizing the Services.</strong> In order to optimize the
          Services provided to you, we keep track of which version of Comm’s
          code you are running as well as the platform that you are using to run
          Comm’s code (e.g., iOS, Android, web server, keyserver). We only
          collect this information to provide the Services to you, and are not
          able to access or view the substance of your Content in connection
          with such collection.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Crash Reports.</strong> If you choose to send us a crash
          report, we may collect data from such reports for purposes of
          debugging and system maintenance. These reports contain operational
          information such as telemetry data (e.g., information with respect to
          the recent connection between the client and server), metadata (e.g.,
          time stamps from messages sent in a conversation or chat), and device
          data (e.g., your device’s operating system) but never contain the
          content of your messages.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Push Notifications.</strong> If you choose to allow push
          notifications to your device, your device’s operating system’s
          provider will know that you are using the Services and may be able to
          see the Content you transmit using the Services. We only collect push
          tokens required to send you such notifications and these tokens do not
          permit us to access or view your Content.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Contact List.</strong> If you allow us to do so, we can
          discover which contacts in your address book are Comm users by using
          technology designed to protect the privacy of you and your contacts.
          If you opt to discover other Comm users in your contact list, phone
          numbers from the contacts on your device, as well as your own phone
          number, will be hashed and transmitted to Comm in order to match you
          and your friends on the Services. Since this contact information is
          hashed, Comm cannot view or access the plaintext version.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cookies.</strong> We only use a single cookie per user in
          order to authenticate a user as being logged in to Comm. Most browsers
          allow you to decide whether to accept these cookies and whether to
          remove any cookies already on your device. If you disable these
          cookies, you will not be able to stay logged into Comm.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bots.</strong> We may communicate with you through the
          Services by using bots, and we will have access to any information you
          voluntarily provide in response to those bots. We only collect this
          information to provide the Services to you, and are not able to access
          or view the substance of any other Content in connection with such
          collection.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Content.</strong> Other Comm users may have access to, and
          have the ability to store, all or some of the Content owned by you.{' '}
          <strong>
            However, as this Content is end-to-end encrypted, we have no ability
            to access or view the substance of your Content.
          </strong>{' '}

          .
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Anonymized Data.</strong> We may create aggregated,
          de-identified or anonymized data from the information we collect from
          you, including by removing information that makes the data personally
          identifiable to you. We may use such aggregated, de-identified or
          anonymized data for our own lawful business purposes, including to
          analyze, build and improve the Services and promote our business,
          provided that we will not use such data in a manner that could
          identify you.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Public Blockchain Information</h2>

      <p>
        Information posted on a blockchain is publicly available and auditable.
        When you and other users use the Services, Comm’s applications will
        automatically make calls to third-party blockchain providers using
        users’ blockchain addresses (including yours) to access publicly
        available information about those blockchain addresses (e.g., ENS name,
        ENS avatar). Such publicly available information will then be displayed
        through the Services to you and/or other Comm users. This information is
        not shared or stored by Comm, and the only information accessible and
        displayed is information that is publicly available on the blockchain.
      </p>

      <p>
        Additionally, if you choose to use Comm’s applications, third-party
        blockchain providers may also have access to your IP address. While your
        IP address is not shared by Comm, it is automatically accessible by such
        providers through your use of Comm’s applications, regardless of whether
        you intend to make such information available. This access is required
        in order to allow Comm users to make calls to third-party blockchain
        providers, and Comm has no control over what such third-party blockchain
        provider may do with your IP address.
      </p>

      <h2>How We May Share Your Information</h2>

      <p>
        We may share the information we collect with third parties for the
        reasons listed below.{' '}
        <strong>
          However, your Content will always remain end-to-end encrypted, even
          when stored in the backup service, and Comm has no ability to decrypt
          that information for any third party.{' '}
        </strong>
        Moreover, we will <strong>never</strong> sell, rent or monetize your
        information.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          To fulfill our legal obligations under applicable law, regulation,
          court order or other legal process.
        </li>
        <li>
          To protect the rights, property or safety of you, Comm Technologies or
          another party as required or permitted by law.
        </li>
        <li>To enforce any agreements with you.</li>
        <li>
          Pursuant to a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or other transaction in
          which that third party assumes control of our business (in whole or in
          part).
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        While sharing your email address is entirely optional, if you do choose
        to share it, we may share that email address, and the contents of any
        email sent by us or you, with our third-party service providers who may
        assist us in providing updates to you. Such information would be shared
        with such third-party service providers for the sole purpose of
        providing you updates on Comm, and will never be associated with your
        account or sold, rented or otherwise monetized.
      </p>

      <p>
        Additionally, Comm uses third-party hosting providers to host its
        central cloud servers, therefore we may share the information we collect
        with such hosting providers in order for them to host this information.
        This information will be shared with such hosting providers for the sole
        purpose of providing the Services to you, and your Content will always
        remain end-to-end encrypted when shared with such hosting providers,
        even when stored in the backup service.
      </p>

      <h2>Retention of Information</h2>

      <p>
        For any of your personal information that we collect, we retain such
        personal information for as long as you have an open account with us or,
        only with respect to the association between your account and public
        key, as otherwise necessary to provide our Services.
      </p>
