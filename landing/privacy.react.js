      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

      <p>
        Effective date: <strong>June 29, 2021</strong>
      </p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        We built Comm as a privacy-focused alternative to the cloud-based
        community chat apps that exist today. In order to protect the privacy of
        user content, communities on Comm are hosted on private keyservers, and
        messages transmitted through the platform are encrypted, preventing us
        from being able to access their contents. While Comm does collect a
        minimal amount of information as necessary to power and maintain the
        Services, Comm will never be able to access or view your messages or
        content. This Privacy Policy describes the limited ways in which Comm
        uses information in connection with its Services.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>
          ‌By using or accessing our Services, you acknowledge that you accept
          the practices and policies outlined below.
        </strong>
      </p>

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

      <p>
        We collect the following categories of information, some of which might
        constitute personal information:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Account Information.</strong> In order to use Comm, you will
          be required to create an account, and in doing so, will be required to
          provide a username and password to us. We only store salted and hashed
          versions of your password – we never store the plaintext version. No
          other information is required to create an account and we do not want
          you to provide any other information.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Updates About the Services.</strong> If you choose to receive
          updates on Comm’s progress, you will be required to provide your email
          address to us. These email addresses will not be associated with any
          accounts, and will not be used for any purpose other than to provide
          updates on Comm.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Time Zone Detection.</strong> When responding to a web
          request, we use the requester’s IP address in order to determine which
          time zone to render timestamps in. We do not store these IP addresses
          or associate them with specific accounts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Security, Fraud and Abuse.</strong> In order to detect and
          prevent abuse of our Services and cyberattacks, we keep track of
          request metadata, which includes requests made by IP addresses as well
          as the frequency of those requests. This data is only stored on a
          short-term basis and is never associated with specific accounts, even
          if the requests themselves originate from or are associated with
          specific accounts. Additionally, we may view and block certain IP
          address ranges as necessary to comply with applicable United States
          export control laws and regulations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Crash Reports.</strong> If you choose to send us a crash
          report, we may collect data from such reports for purposes of
          debugging and system maintenance. These reports contain operational
          information such as telemetry data (e.g., information with respect to
          the recent connection between the client and server), metadata (e.g.,
          time stamps from messages sent in a conversation or chat), and device
          data (e.g., your device’s operating system) but never contain the
          content of your messages.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Push Notifications.</strong> If you choose to allow push
          notifications to your device, your device’s operating system’s
          provider will know that you are using the Services and may be able to
          see the content of the messages you transmit using the Services. We
          only collect push tokens required to send you such notifications and
          these tokens do not permit us to access or view the content of your
          messages.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Contact List.</strong> If you allow us to do so, we can
          discover which contacts in your address book are Comm users by using
          technology designed to protect the privacy of you and your contacts.
          If you opt to discover other Comm users in your contact list, phone
          numbers from the contacts on your device, as well as your own phone
          number, will be hashed and transmitted to Comm in order to match you
          and your friends on the Services. Since this contact information is
          hashed, Comm cannot view or access the plaintext version.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cookies.</strong> We only use a single cookie per user in
          order to authenticate a user as being logged in to Comm. Most browsers
          allow you to decide whether to accept these cookies and whether to
          remove any cookies already on your device. If you disable these
          cookies, you will not be able to stay logged into Comm.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Content.</strong> Other Comm users may have access to all or
          some of the Content owned by you.{' '}
          <strong>
            However, as this Content is end-to-end encrypted, we have no ability
            to access, view or control your Content.

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Anonymized Data.</strong> We may create aggregated,
          de-identified or anonymized data from the information we collect from
          you, including by removing information that makes the data personally
          identifiable to you. We may use such aggregated, de-identified or
          anonymized data for our own lawful business purposes, including to
          analyze, build and improve the Services and promote our business,
          provided that we will not use such data in a manner that could
          identify you.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>How We May Share Your Information</h2>

      <p>
        We have no access to your Content and therefore have no ability to share
        it. As for the very limited information we do collect, we would{' '}

        key, as otherwise necessary to provide our Services.
