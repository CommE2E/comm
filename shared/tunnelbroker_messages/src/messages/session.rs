///   - Client sends ConnectionInitializationMessage
///   - Tunnelbroker validates access_token with identity service
///   - Tunnelbroker emits an AMQP message declaring that it has opened a new
///     connection with a given device, so that the respective tunnelbroker
///     instance can close the existing connection.
///   - Tunnelbroker returns a session_id representing that the connection was
///     accepted
///   - Tunnelbroker will flush all messages related to device from RabbitMQ.
///     This must be done first before flushing DynamoDB to prevent duplicated
///     messages.
///   - Tunnelbroker flushes all messages in DynamoDB
///   - Tunnelbroker orders messages by creation date (oldest first), and sends
///     messages to device
///   - Tunnelbroker then polls for incoming messages from device
