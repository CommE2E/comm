/*
 XCode generated Swift compatibility header is available only
 in the project that implements its header (it is private).
 Therefore we create public header that includes private Swift
 compatibility header so that other projects can use generated
 Objective C interfaces.

 Macro `__has_include` is used since this header is generated
 during library compilation so it is available only after the
 library is compiled. This solution is inspired by:
