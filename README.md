## Comm

Comm is an E2E-encrypted messaging app. You can think of it as Signal with a federated Discord bolted on.

- DMs and group chats are E2EE between devices using pairwise Double Ratchet sessions initiated via X3DH.
- Communities, which consist of a tree structure of channels, are hosted on federated user-run backends that we call keyservers. Communication is encrypted via TLS.

## Repo structure

The client apps and keyserver layer are mostly written in Flow-typed Javascript. These projects are organized in a monorepo structure using Yarn Workspaces.

- `native` contains the code for the React Native app, which supports both iOS and Android.
- `keyserver` contains the code for the Node/Express server.
- `web` contains the code for the React desktop website.
- `landing` contains the code for the [Comm landing page](https://comm.app).
- `lib` contains code that is shared across multiple other workspaces, including most of the Redux stack that is shared across native/web.

Comm's backend services are centralized and never touch plaintext data. They are written in Rust and deployed with Terraform to AWS. These projects are organized in a monorepo structure using Cargo Workspaces.

- `services` contains the various different backend services.
- `shared` contains gRPC and protobuf definitions, and shared Rust libraries.

## Dev environment

Note that it’s currently it’s only possible to contribute to this project from macOS. This is primarily due to iOS native development only being supported in macOS.
